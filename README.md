- For extra slim app : [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).
- Css with components on the go [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

](https://merakiui.com/).

> Tailwind UI kit [Mamba UI](https://mambaui.com/components/hero) A bit crude to the eyes ...

Still searching a good alternative to Express.js; and something not as buged as svelte.kit.

> Exploring https://nestjs.com/ lately and https://loopback.io/ .

## ORM :

> Lil orm I already used, and can recommend.

## Process manager + Monitoring
